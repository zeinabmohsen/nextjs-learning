# nextjs-learning
A repository dedicated to my journey of learning Next.jsâ€”a React framework for building modern web apps. Join me as I experiment, build, and grow my skills. Contributions and feedback welcome! Let's dive into Next.js together! ðŸš€


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
